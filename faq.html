				<h4>How can I receive a computer through BDDP?</h4>
				<p>In order to receive a loaned computer from BDDP, you must participate in computer literacy training at one of our partner agencies. This training is usually provided by BDDP, but some community partners provide their own training. Not all partners are required to participate in the computer loan program, even if they host computer literacy training. In addition, BDDP can only loan computers to individuals through community partners.</p>

				<h4>How can I participate in computer literacy training?</h4>
				<p>Computer literacy training is offered to community members through partner organizations. Training is not offered at every partner organization, so please speak with a representative from your organization to find out when they plan to host classes.</p>


				<h4>Do you provide private computer literacy tutoring?</h4>
				<p>BDDP only provides training through community partner organizations and cannot provide private computer literacy tutoring. We do offer drop-in hours at some locations for individual assistance with specific computer questions.</p>

			<div class="col-md-6">
        <h4>I have a computer I do not want anymore. Can I donate it to BDDP?</h4>
        <p>BDDP currently receives a steady supply of donated computers from Geodis Supply Chain Optimization and therefore does not need private donations. We encourage community members to recycle computers and other electronics through one of these <a href="http://gobroomecounty.com/solidwaste/electronics-recycling/">outlets</a>.</p>

				<h4>How can my organization become a partner?</h4>
				<p>BDDP partners with nonprofit organizations and government agencies with clients who are impacted by the digital divide. To discuss becoming a partner, please send an email to <a href="mailto:bddp@binghamton.edu">bddp@binghamton.edu</a>. Be prepared to discuss the specific computer literacy needs of your clients.</p>

				<h4>I am a Binghamton University or SUNY Broome student. How can I get involved in BDDP?</h4>
				<p>Binghamton University students are needed to provide computer literacy instruction, refurbish computers and provide other support for BDDP. For more information, Binghamton students can email <a href="mailto:bddp@binghamton.edu">bddp@binghamton.edu</a>. SUNY Broome students may participate in computer literacy instruction. For more information, SUNY Broome students should email Sandra Wright at <a href="mailto:wrightsk@sunybroome.edu">wrightsk@sunybroome.edu</a>.
