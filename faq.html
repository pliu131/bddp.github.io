				<h4>How can I receive a computer through BDDP?</h4>
				<p>In order to receive a loaned computer from BDDP, you must participate in computer literacy training at one of our partner agencies (hyperlink). Our contract with Microsoft requires that BDDP only loan computers to individuals through community partners, meaning we cannot loan computers directly to individuals. We also require that computer recipients receive some type of computer literacy training. This training is usually provided by BDDP, but some community partners provide their own training. Partners are not required to participate in the computer loan program even if they host computer literacy training.</p>

				<h4>How can I participate in computer literacy training?</h4>
				<p>Computer literacy training is offered to clients of <a href="#">partner organizations</a>. Training is not offered at every partner at all times, so please talk to a representative at your organization to find out when they plan to host training.  </p>


				<h4>Do you provide private computer literacy tutoring?</h4>
				<p>BDDP only provides training through community partner organizations, so we cannot provide private computer literacy tutoring. We do offer drop-in hours on TIME at LOCATION for individual assistance with specific computer questions.</p>

				<h4>I have a computer I do not want anymore. Can I donate it to BDDP?</h4>
				<p>BDDP currently receives a steady supply of donated computers from <a href="#">Geodis</a> and therefore does not need private donations. We encourage community members to recycle computers and other electronics through <a href="#">Eco International</a>. BDDP also hosts community collection drives.</p>

				<h4>How can my organization become a partner?</h4>
				<p>BDDP partners with nonprofit organizations and government agencies whose clients are impacted by the digital divide. Partners are required to sign and follow a Memorandum of Understanding (provide sample). To discuss becoming a partner, please contact X. Be prepared to discuss the specific computer literacy needs of your clients.</p>

				<h4>Can BDDP assist my organization with its computer lab?</h4>
				<p>BDDP provides assistance with computer labs to partners on a case-by-case basis. This assistance is limited to preparing a lab for computer literacy training, and is provided on a case-by-case basis only based on the availability of volunteers. Partners are responsible for ongoing maintenance of the lab.</p>

				<h4>I am a Binghamton University or Broome Community College student. How can I get involved in BDDP?</h4>
				<p>Binghamton University and Broome Community College students are needed to provide computer literacy instruction, refurbish computers and provide other support for BDDP. For more information, Binghamton students can refer to LINK and Broome Community College can go to LINK.</p>
