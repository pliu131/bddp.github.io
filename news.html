      <p><em>April 2013</em></p>
      <p>School of Management students Dali Lu, Oyuka Baatarkhuyag, Michael Genito, Ying Zhu and Joyce Wenjing Xu, have received the first place prize in this year's Ernst &amp; Young, LLP "Your World, Your Vision" national competition.The competition asked students to submit an original and creative proposal to make a positive impact in their communities in one of three areas: education, entrepreneurship or the environment â€” the same areas of focus for E&amp;Y's corporate responsibility efforts.</p>
      <p>As the first place-winners, the team will receive a $10,000 grant from Ernst &amp; Young to implement its proposal to create a student-run organization that will collect unwanted computers, refurbish them and return them back to the community through volunteer-led computer literacy classes. In addition, they will pair directly with the Center for Civic Engagement's Bridging the Digital Divide Program to further their reach and increase their overall impact on computer literacy.</p>

      <p>Binghamton University's Center for Civic Engagement and Broome Community College hosted a Community Issues Forum on the Digital Divide on May 11, 2011. The forum featured a variety of speakers and displays from students, faculty, and community organizations involved with the Bridging the Digital Divide Project. </p>

      <h2 id="bddp-volunteer-receives-national-recognition">BDDP Volunteer Receives National Recognition</h2>
      <p>The Bridging the Digital Divide Project is thrilled to announce that volunteer, Jack Rappaport, has received the President's Volunteer Service Award for 2011! Through his participation in IBM's On Demand Community, which allows retired IBM employees to log their volunteer hours, Rappaport has been recognized by the White House for his service to the community. Congratulations, Jack, and thank you for your hard work and dedication.</p>
      <h2 id="faculty-community-scholars-program">Faculty Community Scholars Program</h2>
      <p>A new program offered by the Center for Civic Engagement will provide four faculty members the opportunity to develop or modify a course that incorporates service learning and supports the Bridging the Digital Divide Project.</p>
      <p>Each faculty member will receive a $1,000 stipend, a service-learning mentor, funding for course materials and student projects, and recognition as a Faculty Community Scholar. The courses will be taught during the 2011-12 school year and hopefully on a regular basis after that. Scholars and students also will share their experiences at a Community Issues Forum at the end of the school year.</p>
      <p>â€œWe are going to try to maintain a commitment to identify and support Faculty Community Scholars,â€ said Allison Alden, the Center for Civic Engagement director who developed the program. â€œPart of the reason I am committed to this is that we need to acknowledge that we have so many faculty who currently integrate their classes in wonderful ways and we have others who want to do the same thing.â€</p>
